Where’s Yolanda Harris going now?
She’s going to the bank.
What’s she going to do at the bank?
She’s going to open a checking account.
Is she going to the Bank of America?
Yes, she is. It’s not far from her home.
2.
I would like to open a checking account.
Good. Could you please fill out this card?
And I want to deposit $200.00 in it.
I need to see two pieces of identification.
I would like to have an ATM card also.
Yes. It is our Versateller card.
3.
You can use it at any of our ATM machines.
Is there a charge for using it?
No, because you have an account here.
How many checks may I write per month?
You may write an unlimited number of checks.
I would like to order some checks please.
4.
Here are the different check styles.
I like these blue checks with the red flowers.
All right. I can order five hundred of those.
When will I receive my checks?
It takes about two weeks. Until then, you can use these.
Is there overdraft protection ?
5.
Yes. There’s $500.00 overdraft protection.
What does overdraft protection mean?
If you overdraw your account, the bank will pay.
Do I have to pay interest on the overdraft?
Yes, you do. Overdraft protection is a bank loan.
I understand. Well, thank you for your help.
6.
You might want to have a savings account too.
Yes, I’m very interested.
Our regular savings account pays 2 percent interest.
Is there a penalty for withdrawal?
No, there isn’t.
Good. I would like to open a savings account.
7.
I tried to use the ATM machine, but it’s closed.
You can use the ATM machine down the street.
But, it’s a different bank. I have to pay a charge.
How much do you have to pay?
It’s usually a dollar and a half.
That’s right. When you use Versateller, it’s free.
8.
That’s right. It’s free because I have an account.
Do you need anything at the supermarket?
Why are you asking me that?
Because you can get cash back with any purchase.
Will they accept my ATM card?
Of course. And there’s no charge for cash back.
9.
Don’t use the ATM machine at night.
Why not? Is it dangerous?
It’s not safe. It’s better to use it in the day time.
You’re right. I heard that somebody was robbed.
A robber can steal your ATM card.
And then the robber can withdraw all my money.
10.
We spent too much money last month.
Are we using our overdraft?
Yes, we are. We only have $100.00 left in it.
We need to budget our income more carefully.
That’s right. And we should pay off our overdraft.
We’ll pay it off with our next paychecks.
