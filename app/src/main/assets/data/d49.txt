1.
What’s the work schedule?
Monday to Friday, 8:30 am to 5:30 pm.
I heard there was night work also.
That’s right. There’s night work 3 or 4 times a month. Is that okay?
Yes. Some night work is no problem for me.
Good. I’ll see you on Monday.
2.
How much overtime work is there?
You’ll work overtime about once a month.
Good. A little overtime isn’t a problem for me.
Do you know about the fringe benefits?
No, I don’t. Please tell me about them.
Employees get one sick day per month.
3.
That’s very fair. How about paid holidays?
Yes. We have paid holidays as well.
How many paid holidays do we get per year?
You will get ten paid holidays per year.
I would like to know about the health plan.
All employees have health coverage.
4.
What shift do you work? Day or night?
I have been working days recently.
Oh? Did you use to work nights?
That’s right. I worked nights until last month.
How did you get changed to the day shift?
I put in a request with my supervisor.
5.
Are you still working as a stunt man?
Yes, but I’m thinking of quitting.
You are? I didn’t know that. Why?
The work is too dangerous. I might get hurt.
Is that the only reason?
No. I want a job with better working conditions.
6.
Could you help me with this form?
I’ll try. What’s your question?
I left my last job because my mother was ill.
I suggest you write “family illness.”
Where it says “reason for leaving your job?”
That’s right. That’s my advice.
7.
I’ll try to answer your question. What is it?
I left my last job because I hurt my back.
I suggest you simply write “injury”.
Just write “injury?” Nothing else?
Yes. But tell them you’re okay now.
Okay, I will. Thanks very much for your advice.
8.
You look tired. Is the job getting to you?
I’m afraid so. The hours are too long.
You should look for a job with shorter hours.
Yes, I think I should. I agree with you.
I also think you can find a higher salary.
Do you think so? I’ll try. Thanks for the advice.
9.
Maria, hi. How do you like your new job?
I like it, but I’m afraid I will lose it.
Lose It? Why? I thought your work was good.
They like my work. But I have to quit.
Maria, you can’t quit. You’re a good worker.
I have to quit. I didn’t tell you. I’m pregnant.
10.
Maria, you can request maternity leave.
Maternity leave? What’s that?
You have three months off with pay.
You mean I can have my baby and my job?
That’s right. It’s the company policy.
I’m so happy. I love my job. But, I want to be a good mother, too.
