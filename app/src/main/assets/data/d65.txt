1.
Hello. I’m detective Robinson of the San Francisco Police Department.
Nice to meet you. I didn’t do anything wrong.
Someone was murdered in this neighborhood.
I’m sorry to hear that. How can I help you?
You might be able to help the investigation.
I’m happy to answer any questions you have.
2.
Did you hear a gun shot around 8:00 this evening?
I heard a loud noise. But it sounded like a firecracker.
What were you doing when you heard that shot?
I was washing dishes, and my wife was writing a letter.
Were you walking on the street at any time this evening?
No, I don’t think so. Wait. I might have gone to the corner to buy a paper.
3.
You might have gone to the corner to buy a paper?
Yes. In fact, I remember now, I went out around 7:45.
7:45. That’s fifteen minutes before the murder occurred.
I suppose so. But I didn’t hear anything on the walk.
You said you heard something like a firecracker.
Yes, when I was washing dishes, I heard a firecracker.
4.
And when were you washing dishes?
I was washing dishes around 8:00. Yes, I’m sure of it.
When did you return from the store with the paper?
I got back from the store at 8:10. I looked at my watch.
Now, just a moment. Let me get this straight. You left at 7:45 to get a newspaper.
That’s right. I like to read the paper after I wash the dishes.
5.
And you got back from the store at 8:10. You looked at your watch.
Say, is this investigation going to take much longer?
Sorry to bother you. Give me another couple of minutes.
Because I have a lot of work to do tonight.
I understand. But solving this murder is important.
Also, my favorite TV program is on tonight. Last week it was canceled because of a wrestling match.
6.
I enjoy watching wrestling matches. I look forward to that program every week.
I avoid watching wrestling. The violence upsets me.
You don’t like violence, however you own a gun.
I own a gun? What gave you that idea?
I did a little research before this visit. There is a gun registered to your name. Here’s a copy of the form.
Yes, as a matter of fact, I own a gun. However, I fire it rarely.
7.
May I have a look at your firearm please?
Yes. It’s right here in my pocket. But I don’t know why you want to look at it.
It’s a little warm. Why is it warm? It feels warm to me.
I’ve been carrying it in my pocket, that’s why.
Are you trying to tell me that your pocket is warm?
Yes. Here’s my wallet. It’s warm too. I don’t know what you’re driving at.
8.
I’m simply trying to get to the bottom of this murder.
Well, maybe you should take your investigation somewhere else. I’m getting bored.
Are you? I thought you enjoyed murder investigations.
I’m feeling nervous all of a sudden. All these questions.
How was it possible for you to wash dishes at 8:00?
It was very possible. I used dish soap and a sponge.
9.
But you clearly said that you were at the store between 7:45 pm and 8:10 pm.
Exactly. I went to the store to buy a paper. Why must I keep on repeating things?
And yet you were here washing dishes at 8:00 pm.
The very idea that I fired a shot and hit a young man in the back is absurd.
How did you know he was a young man? 
Well, I ... I ....
10.
And how did you know that he was shot in the back?
It’s obvious that you have chosen the wrong man to investigate. I did nothing wrong.
You have warm gun and you know certain facts.
I have eyes don’t I? I can see the street from here.
You were looking at the street when the shot was fired?
Absolutely not. Why would I? That’s ridiculous.
