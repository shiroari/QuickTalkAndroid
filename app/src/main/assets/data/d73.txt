1.
I was supposed to go to the dentist, but I forgot.
Did you miss your dental appointment?
It completely slipped my mind. I’ve had my yearly physical, but I haven’t had my dental exam yet.
You’d better call the dentist office now and make another appointment.
I’ve been brushing my teeth regularly and using floss.
I wouldn’t worry about your teeth if I were you.
2.
Something came up. I can’t go to the movies with you.
Oh, that’s all right. We can do it another time.
My boss told me I have to work a double shift today.
We can take a rain check. No problem. Next weekend, if you aren’t doing anything, we can go.
Yes, I think I’ll be free next weekend. I’ll give you a call.
3.
I went to see “Mission to Mars” at the Metro Theater.
I wanted to see it too, but I was busy. How was it?
You didn’t miss much. The story wasn’t very interesting.
I went to the museum. The paintings were exciting.
I want to go there. I haven’t seen their current exhibit.
I think you’d enjoy it a lot.
4.
If you take a keyboarding class, you’ll learn to type 25 words per minute.
When do they offer keyboarding?
In the morning, from 8:30 to 12:15. Gloria Bautista is the teacher.
I’m really interested in learning about computers.
This class is a very good introduction.
I know how to type, but I type very slowly.
5.
Have you taken the books back to the library yet?
Not yet. I plan to drop them off this afternoon.
They should have been taken back yesterday.
You’re right. They were due yesterday, weren’t they?
That’s all right. The fine is only ten cents a book.
I borrowed eight books. I’ll have to pay 80 cents.
6.
Last week, somebody parked in front of my driveway.
What did you do? Did you call the police?
Yes. I had to call them. I didn’t have any other choice.
Did you give them the license number ?
Yes, I did. The police came about an hour later. The car was towed away.
There aren’t enough parking spaces in this city.
7.
There will be a neighborhood meeting tonight.
Oh, good. I’ll be there. What are we discussing?
We’re discussing some neighborhood problems
There have been quite a few problems lately.
Yes, there have. There’s been a lot of noise from construction.
Yes, and sometimes it lasts until late at night. 
8.
There are other problems in our neighborhood.
People drive too fast. It’s dangerous for children.
That’s right. They should put up more stop signs.
Last week, I saw an accident that could have been avoided.
It wouldn’t have happened if there had been a stop sign.
If the neighbors speak up, we can make some changes.
9.
Did you go to the meeting last night?
Yes, I did. Most of the neighbors attended it. 
I’m sorry I couldn’t go to it. I had to work late.
It was the best meeting we’ve had so far.
What problems did the neighbors discuss?
We discussed crime, parking, drugs, and noise.
10.
We didn’t decide on a location for the next meeting.
You can hold the next meeting at my house. 
That’s very generous of you. We’ll probably accept your offer.
How many do you think might show up to the meeting?
I would guess around twenty-five people. Is that too many?
No, it’s not. Since I wasn’t able to come last night, I want to contribute something.
