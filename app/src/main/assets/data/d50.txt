1.
I have great news. Jose graduated.
Patricia finished college, too.
Jose and Patricia are getting married.
I know, isn’t that wonderful?
They’ve wanted to get married for a long time.
That’s right. I’m glad they waited.
2.
Jose has very good training in computers.
I heard he had several job offers.
Patricia is getting her teaching credential.
When is their wedding going to be?
It will be in June. They’re planning a big one.
I’m very excited. And I’m sure they are, too.
3.
Hello, Mrs. Sanchez? This is Yolanda Harris.
Yolanda. It’s nice to hear your voice.
I want to help with the wedding.
Oh, thank you, Yolanda. We sure need help.
I know. You’re planning to have a big one.
They have so many friends and relatives.
4.
We could use help sending invitations.
I’d be glad to help send invitations.
Jose needs to choose a best man.
He hasn’t chosen one yet? I’ll talk to him.
Patty has already chosen her maids of honor.
Does she have the flower girls yet?
5.
There are so many decisions to make.
Have you decided about the reception.
No, we haven’t. What’s your suggestion?
We should have it in the church basement.
Is the church basement suitable?
Yes, it is. It’s very large and very clean.
6.
Hello, Yolanda? This is Eva Sanchez.
Eva, are you all right? You sound nervous.
I am nervous. The wedding is in two weeks!
Don’t worry. All the invitations have been sent.
Yes, but we need to have a rehearsal.
That’s true. We’d better schedule one.
7.
This is it. The big day. I’m very nervous.
Don’t be nervous, Jose. There’s no reason.
No reason to be nervous? Are you crazy?
Jose, it’s only your wedding day.
I don’t want to get married. I’m too scared.
Don’t be scared, Jose. You love Patricia!
8.
This is it, mother. I’m getting married.
Yes, but Patricia, you’re late. Hurry up.
I don’t want to hurry. I want to look just right.
Patricia, you combed your hair too much.
My fingernails look terrible. My lips are ugly.
Patricia, you look great. Now, will you hurry?
9.
Jose, do you take Patricia to be your wife?
I do. And I’m very happy about it.
Do you have a token of your commitment?
Yes, I have a wedding ring somewhere.
You have a wedding ring somewhere?
Yes. But I lost it. No. Here it is. Here, Patty.
10.
Oh, look. The groom and bride are kissing.
Yes, they are. Don’t cry, Eva.
My little girl isn’t little any more.
No. And my son is all grown up. Look at him.
Stop crying, Yolanda. The wedding is over.
Let’s go drink some champagne at the reception.
