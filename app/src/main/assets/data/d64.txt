1.
The piano movers just called. They can’t come today.
Oh, no. We have to move the piano today.
We’ll have to move it to the other room ourselves.
We can’t move it ourselves. It’s much too heavy.
We’ll have to try. I know. We’ll put the rug under it.
Good idea. Then, we’ll slide it into the other room.
2.
We were successful. We moved the piano.
Now, we have more space in the living room.
The problem is, we have less space in the dining room.
The dining room is a good place for the piano.
I’m not sure. The trouble is, the piano needs work.
That’s true. The piano is kind of out of tune, isn’t it?
3.
There’s one other little problem. There’s a leak in the stove. I smell gas in the kitchen.
Then, we have to call P. G. and E. right away.
Will they come over and fix it?
Usually they fix gas leaks. I’m fairly certain.
I didn’t know that because we’ve never had a gas leak before.
Are there any other problems we need to discuss?
4.
I don’t know about you, but I’m annoyed by the neighbors.
You mean the noise they are always making?
Yes. They play their stereo at two in the morning sometimes.
I think we should talk to them about it.
What should we say?
We should ask them politely to turn off their stereo after 10:00 pm.
5.
I don’t know if we’ll ever solve all our problems.
What now?
Somebody parked their car in front of our house.
Oh, you’re talking about the blue car. It’s been there at least a month.
That’s right. And it’s very dirty and messy.
I’m sure that someone has abandoned that car
6.
That’s what I think. What should we do about it?
We should report the car to the police. 
What will the police do about it?
First, they’ll put a warning notice on the car with a deadline for removing it.
And if the owners don’t remove it, the police will tow it away?
Yes, and we need to get rid of it soon. 
7.
We have too many books and CD’s and no place to put them.
I know, I’ll build some book shelves. It’s not hard.
Here’s a design for a nice bookshelf. It’s in Sunset Magazine.
Our bookshelf needs to be larger than that one.
You’re right. We need a place to store all these magazines.
We need to take a trip to the lumber yard and the hardware store.
8.
Didn’t you say you were going to build a bookshelf?
Yes, I remember thinking about it last weekend.
You haven’t built it yet. 
I know. I haven’t gotten around to it yet, but I will.
When do you think you might do it?
I just haven’t had the time. I’ve been at work too much. By the time I get home, I’m exhausted.
9.
After we build the shelves, it would be nice to plant flowers.
Where would we plant flowers? The front yard is concrete.
But there’s dirt under the concrete. We just have to break the concrete.
That’s really difficult. I don’t have the energy to do it.
It’s no problem, really. The concrete is probably thin.
Probably thin you say. But you don’t know for sure.
10.
Isn’t it wonderful? We should celebrate.
Celebrate? I’m too wiped out to celebrate.
But look at all we’ve accomplished. We moved the  piano.
We got rid of the abandoned car in front of the house.
The neighbors are finally quiet after 10:00 pm.
And we have flowers in the front yard. Did I forget something?
You never built the bookshelf.
