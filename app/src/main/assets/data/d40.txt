Mother, I want to marry Patricia.
But Jose, you’re only eighteen years old.
That’s true, but I have a very good job.
Yes. You’re an excellent carpenter, but ...
I can support a family with my salary.
I think you and Patricia should wait.
2.
Hi, Jose. It’s nice to see you again.
Hi, Patricia. I just talked to my mother.
You look upset. What did she say?
She said we shouldn’t get married now.
My mother feels the same way. We should wait.
It’s difficult to wait. I really want to marry you.
3.
Hello, Mrs. Sanchez? This is Yolanda Harris.
Oh, yes. You’re Jose’s mother, aren’t you.
That’s right. And you’re Patricia’s mother.
Yes. I think you’re calling because you’re worried.
I’m worried about my son and your daughter.
They’re too young to get married.
4.
Well, Patricia really loves Jose very much.
I know. And Jose really loves Patricia.
However, Patricia is still in high school.
Right. And Jose just graduated from high school.
They should wait at least another year.
Jose needs to go to college.
5.
Patricia plans to attend City College next year.
Don’t misunderstand. I like Patricia very much.
I like Jose, too. He’s a fine young man.
I would like to have Patricia for a daughter in law.
Jose will be a good son in law.
But after they finish college. That’s much better.
6.
If Patricia has a baby, she can’t study in college.
If Jose becomes a father, he must work too hard.
They both need time to study.
I completely agree with you.
We must persuade our children.
I hope they listen to reason.
7.
I agree with you, mother.
I’m glad you agree with me, Patricia.
We can wait two more years.
Yes. In that time, you can prepare for the future.
We will have a better marriage.
I want you both to be happy.
8.
But Dad, Patricia and I love each other.
I know you do, but you need to study.
I have a very good job right now.
Did you say you wanted to learn computers?
Yes. But I said that before I met Patricia.
That shouldn’t make any difference.
9.
Patricia, do you want to marry me?
Yes, Jose, but I talked to my parents.
I talked to my parents also.
Your parents agree with my parents.
They say we shouldn’t get married right now.
We should plan for our future.
10.
I’m afraid to wait, Patricia.
Why are you afraid to wait, Jose?
I’m afraid you won’t love me after college.
I will always love you, Jose.
That makes me feel better. Okay, we’ll wait.
I’m glad we listened to our parents.
