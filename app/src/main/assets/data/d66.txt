Mother, I’m tired. I don’t feel like going to school today.
No wonder you’re tired. You stayed up until 2:00 am.
Can I sleep just a little longer? I’ll be on time for my 9:30 class.
But Joe, this is the fourth class you’ve missed so far.
I know, but I can catch up. Steve takes good notes.
You must not always rely on Steve or your other friends.
2.
Why did you stay out so late last night?
There was a party at Steve’s house. 
I didn’t want to leave. I was having too much fun.
Why did Steve have a party on a week night?
He wanted it because his parents weren’t home.
His parents weren’t home? 
Were there any adults at this party?
No, there weren’t any adults there. 
That’s why we had a good time.
3.
I don’t want you to go to a party unless adults are present. Did you drink anything?
I only had a couple of beers. And I had a little vodka.
Joe, you must not go to Steve’s house and drink alcohol. Promise me you won’t do it again.
Before last night, I had never drunk so much alcohol. 
Even though you have a hangover, you must get up and go to school.
All right. I apologize for staying out late and drinking. I’ll stay home tonight and study hard.
You told me you were going to Steve’s house to study English. You didn’t say anything about a party.

This is Washington High School. Is Joe ill?
What do you mean? Didn’t he come to school today?
He hasn’t arrived at school yet.
His first period teacher reported him absent.
There must be a mistake. He left for school a half hour ago. He should be there by now.
Just one moment, I see his teacher now. I’ll ask him if Joe showed up.
Joe Adams. You’d better shape up fast or I’m going to be very upset.
5.
It’s okay, Mrs. Adams. Joe is here. He was ten minutes late to class.
Ten minutes late? Why was he so late?
He would’ve been on time if he hadn’t missed the bus. 
Why did he miss the bus today?
His teacher will mark him tardy, that’s all.
How many times has he been late for his first class?
6.
Joe, we have to sit down and talk about this.
I don’t have time to talk right now. I have to go to Steve’s house.
Steve’s house? Is Steve having another party?
I’m going to Steve’s house to study English. 
Steve is a good student. He said he would help me.
But that’s what you said the last time you went to Steve’s house. 
I know. I wasn’t telling the truth. I admit it. I won’t drink anything except water or soda.
7.
Before you go over there, listen to me a minute.
I don’t have much time to get ready.
You’ve been going to Steve’s a lot. You’ve been missing the bus and getting to school late.
All of that is going to change. I’ll do much better.
You haven’t been doing your English homework. You barely passed English last semester.
I know that. I’m working very hard. I read several pages everyday.
8.
It is very important to do well in high school.
I have been listening to you for ten minutes. 
You’ve been listening to me, but you haven’t been doing the right thing.
Stop lecturing me. Can’t you leave me alone?
I want to be independent. I want to do what I want to do.
If you get bad grades, you will damage your future.
Oh, all right. I guess you’re right. I’ve decided I’m not going to Steve’s. I’ll stay home and study.

Hello, Mrs. Adams? This is Judy Wells. Do you remember me?
Of course, you’re Joe’s English teacher. 
We met each other at the meeting we had last week.
Yes, I thought it was a very good meeting.
I’m happy to tell you that Joe got an ‘A’ in his last paper.
Well, I’m very pleased to hear that. Thank you for calling.
