Hello, is this Joe’s Auto Repair Shop?
Yes, it is. How may I help you?
This is Mrs. Parker. I’m calling about my car. Has it been repaired yet?
Not yet. It’s being repaired right now.
How soon do you think it’ll be ready?
It should be ready by 4:00 pm. We’ll call you when it’s done.

Jack was able to repair the car very quickly.
He must have a lot of experience.
He does. He’s been a mechanic for eight years.
I’ll be sure and recommend him to my friends.
He looks tired. How many cars has he repaired today?
Believe it or not, he’s already repaired ten cars.
3.
Your car isn’t ready yet. We’re still working on it.
I don’t understand why you’re still working on it. You’ve had it for three days.
To tell the truth, we can’t figure out what’s wrong with it.
You can't? But my friend Bob told me you were the best mechanic in the city.
I just don’t know how to fix your car, to be honest.
There must be something you can do for it.
4.
The car is very poorly designed, for one thing.
Do you know how much I paid for that car?
I can understand your frustration, believe me. I’ve been in the same boat myself.
What are you saying? Are you saying I have purchased a lemon?
I’m afraid so. I would take it back to dealer and see if they can do anything.
I’ve already taken it there. They sent me to you.
5.
I took my car to the mechanic and he couldn’t fix it.
Why wasn’t he able to fix your car?
He said I must have bought a lemon. I feel awful about it.
If I were you, I would get another opinion.
I love my car. I don’t want to get rid of it.
Of course, you don’t. You just need to consult a different specialist.
6.
I’ve given up trying to get my car fixed. It’s impossible.
Really? Are you going to buy another car?
I’m going to try to trade this one in and get a good used car in exchange.
Good idea. You’re making the best of a bad deal.
Exactly. I really don’t have any other options.
Don’t feel bad. It’s just a car.
I’m beginning to come around to that point of view.
7.
Tom. I didn’t know you were coming to the DMV today.
Judy. I’m really glad I ran into you. Can you help me?
I’ll try. What do you need?
I’m applying for my learner’s permit today and I have to take the test.
Do you want me to ask you some questions so you can review?
Yes, I would appreciate it. Just one or two questions.
8.
Are you allowed to cross a solid double line?
Definitely not. You can’t pass another car if there’s a double solid line.
When you see a sign that says “Yield”, what must you do?
You must give the right of way to the other driver.
Good again. Now, tell me if you see “Wrong Way Go Back,” what must you do?
You may keep going, but you have to be very careful.
No. “Wrong Way Go Back” means it’s a freeway exit, not a freeway entrance.
9.
Thank you for helping me study for my test, Judy.
How did you do? Did you pass it?
Yes, I was lucky. I didn’t study for it very long.
You didn’t seem to know all the answers.
But, I knew the answers to most of the questions.
I haven’t applied for my Learner’s Permit yet. I’m here to get my ID card.
10.
I have my Learner’s Permit, but I haven’t learned how to drive yet.
You should learn from a qualified instructor.
You’re right. But they cost money, don’t they?
They cost money, but they’re worth it.
Good advice. I’ll check out driving schools today.
I don’t think you’ll regret it. In the long run, you’ll be glad you did.
