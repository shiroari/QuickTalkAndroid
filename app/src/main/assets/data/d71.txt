1.
What kind of car are you planning to buy?
I haven’t decided. Something economical.
I heard Toyota Tercels are economical. They don’t use a lot of gas.
How do they handle on the highway? Do you know?
No, I don’t. I’ve never driven one.
Actually, I’m thinking about a VW Golf. I’d like to drive to LA and visit relatives.
2.
Tercels are the most efficient car on the market.
My aunt and uncle have a Tercel, and they hate it.
Really? Why? 
They said it doesn’t drive very smoothly. 
They’re thinking of selling it and buying a Golf.
No kidding? Well, as I said, I’ve never driven a Tercel.
No, you might be right. 
I’ll test drive a Tercel and see how it feels.
3.
Guess what? I’m going to LA next week. 
How are you getting there, by car or by plane?
That’s a tough choice. What do you think?
If I were you, I’d fly. You can always rent a car in LA.
Actually, I was thinking of driving. It would be cheaper.
You have a point. But it takes a lot longer to drive.
4.
It’s not that much cheaper when you figure how much gas costs these days.
I know. Gas is really expensive. 
And I heard it’s going to get even more expensive.
Still, I would save money driving instead of flying.
You’re probably right. Do you have a place to stay down there?
Yes, I’m staying in my aunt and uncle’s guest room.
5.
Which freeway are you going to take?
I’m considering taking the coast route, Highway 101. What do you think? 
Highway 5 is a lot faster. You save about two hours.
True. But 101 is much more scenic. 
There’s a nice restaurant just off Highway 5. It’s called Harris Ranch.
I plan to drive the coast route and enjoy the scenery.
6.
What’s your plan? Are you going to drive your new Golf down there?
Yes, and I’m very excited. I’ve never driven to LA before.
Are you driving to LA by yourself?
Yes. I asked Sally to go with me, but she’s too busy.
Be very careful. Don’t fall asleep at the wheel.
No. If I feel sleepy, I’ll pull off the road and take a nap.
7.
If you get lost, you can look at your map. 
I always take a map with me because sometimes I like to go on side trips.
Oh? What side trip are you going on this time?
I want to drive around Santa Barbara a little. I’ve never been to Santa Barbara.
The coast is nice and Santa Barbara is beautiful. 
I might grab a meal in Santa Barbara before I go to LA.
8.
Do you think I can get to LA on one tank of gas?
I doubt it. I’m sure you’ll have to stop at a gas station.
That’s okay. I’ll have to stop anyway to eat dinner.
Where are you thinking of eating dinner? Burger King or MacDonalds?
I refuse to stop at any of those fast food restaurants. 
I want a nice meal if I’m going to drive for seven hours.
Good luck finding a decent restaurant off Highway 101. 
9.
How was your weekend in LA? Did you enjoy driving down there?
I took your suggestion and drove Highway 5. It was pretty fast.
Did you stop at the Harris Ranch?
Yes, I had a real nice dinner there. 
You weren’t disappointed by the scenery?
I didn’t care for the scenery much, but I brought some good music so I was entertained.
10.
I drove back to San Francisco by the coast route.
It must have taken much longer. 
Yes, it took a lot longer. But the scenery was very nice, especially the ocean.
Did you stop in Santa Barbara as you had planned?
Yes, I did. I drove around Santa Barbara and had a bite to eat there.
I’m glad you enjoyed your trip in spite of everything.
