1.
I would like some ground beef, please.
How much would you like?
May I have a pound and a half?
It weighs a little more than that. Is it okay?
That’s okay. Do I pay for it here?
No, you don’t. You can pay the cashier.
2.
I didn’t buy everything. I forgot to buy apples.
That’s okay. I’ll go and get some.
We need about two pounds of apples.
Where can I find them? Do you know?
Yes. As you enter the store, the produce is on the left.
I’ll be back in a little while.
3.
Could you go to the store for me?
Sure, what do you need?
I need some salt. I ran out.
Can I get anything else for you?
Yes, you can. I could use a pound of butter.
Okay. I’d better hurry. The store closes soon.
4.
Did you go to the supermarket yesterday?
Yes, I did. I bought several things there.
What vegetables did you buy?
I bought a head of lettuce and some onions.
Did you buy any broccoli?
No. They didn’t have any. They were out.
5.
Is your supermarket convenient?
Sometimes it’s convenient. Sometimes it’s not.
What do you mean?
Sometimes, the supermarket is very crowded.
What do you do when it’s crowded?
I wait in line a long time, and I get impatient.
6.
Does Cynthia like to go to the supermarket?
No, she doesn’t. It’s too far from her house.
Where does she prefer to go shopping?
She prefers the small stores in her neighborhood.
But, those stores are more expensive, right?
That’s right, but they’re more convenient for her.
7.
Excuse me. I couldn’t find the fresh peaches.
Did you look in the produce section?
Yes, but I didn’t find any peaches there.
Oh, that’s right. We’re out of them right now.
When will you have fresh peaches?
Fresh peaches are coming tomorrow.
8.
Do you buy soap at the supermarket?
Not usually. I find cheaper soap at MacFrugal’s.
Macfrugal’s? What kind of store is that?
It’s a discount store. They have many sale items.
Can I buy paper towels there?
I’m not sure. You’ll have to see for yourself.
9.
What do we need at the supermarket?
Let’s see. We need a half gallon of milk.
I’m writing it down. Anything else?
A couple of bottles of diet soda.
How many loaves of bread should I get?
Get a couple of loaves of whole wheat bread.
10.
I went to the supermarket, and now I’m upset.
Why? Did you forget to bring the list? 
No, I remembered the list. But I spent $80.00.
$80.00? That’s a lot of money.
I know it is. I didn’t think I bought that much.
Maybe we should try a different supermarket.
