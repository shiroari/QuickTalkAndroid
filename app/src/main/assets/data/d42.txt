How is Alberto doing in school?
He’s doing very well in Math. He’s getting an ‘A’.
That’s great. He must study very hard.
However, he isn’t doing well in English.
He isn’t? Is he having trouble with it?
Yes, he is. It’s difficult for him. He’s getting a ‘C’.

I recommend you ask about a tutor.
A tutor? What is a tutor?
If a subject is difficult, a tutor will help the student.
That’s great. How can I find a tutor?
Ask your son’s teacher. She might recommend one.
I’ll do it right away. Thanks for the advice.
3.
Are you going to the school’s ‘open house?’
Yes, I am. I want to meet my daughter’s teachers.
It’s a good idea to meet the teachers.
Also, the teachers will explain about their classes.
I want to help my son with his homework.
I’ll see you at the open house.

Excuse me. I’m Mrs. Sanchez. I’m Dora’s mother.
Oh, yes, Mrs. Sanchez. It’s nice to meet you.
Could you tell me how Dora is doing in this class?
I’m happy to say, Dora is doing very well.
Oh, I’m glad to hear that.
She’s making a lot of progress. Don’t worry about her.
5.
Excuse me. I’m Mr. Hernandez. I’m Pedro’s father.
Oh, yes. Mr. Hernandez. Nice meeting you.
Would you tell me if Pedro is handing in his homework on time?
Yes, Mr. Hernandez. He never hands it in late.
Oh, I’m glad to hear that.
Don’t worry, Mr. Hernandez. He’s one of my best students.
6.
Alberto is doing much better in English now.
That’s great to hear. Did he study with a tutor?
Yes, he did. And the tutor helped him a lot.
I knew a tutor would help Alberto.
Alberto’s grade in English is better. He got a ‘B”.
I knew Alberto would do well. He’s very smart.

Welcome to the school open house.
Thank you, but I don’t know where I should go.
Do you have your child’s class schedule?
No, I don’t. Where can I get a copy?
Go to the principal’s office. She’ll give you one.
I see her office. It’s across the hall.
8.
Here is a copy of your child’s class schedule.
Where should I go next?
Go to Dora’s first class of day, in room 113.
I’m not sure where to find that room.
Here is a floor plan of the school. The room numbers are clearly marked.
Thank you for explaining everything.
9.
Excuse me. I’m Mrs. Sanchez. I’m Dora’s mother.
Oh, Mrs. Sanchez. Your daughter is an excellent student.
I’m concerned about her social skills.
Yes. Dora is a little shy, but she has friends.
I think she’s a little afraid of the other students.
Don’t worry. She’s new here. She’ll get over it.
10.
I have good news. Pedro is finishing high school.
Congratulations. When will he graduate?
He will graduate this June.
Does he have any plans for college?
Yes, he does. He’s going to U. C. Berkeley next year.
U. C. Berkeley? That’s a great school. And it’s difficult to get into.
